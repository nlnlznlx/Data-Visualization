            <p>Besides beer, fries and chocolate, the statue of Manneken Pis (‘the little peeing boy’) is one of the most famous icons of Belgium. Located in the center of Brussels, it receives millions of visitors per year. But did you know that around half of the year, Manneken Pis wears special costumes, donated by institutions all over the world? The <a href="https://www.mannekenpis.brussels/en/">GardeRobe Museum</a> in Brussels preserves the more than 1000 costumes that were donated to the statue starting from 1747. On this website, you can explore where these costumes come from, what they represent and how Manneken Pis’ wardrobe has changed over the years.</p>

                <div class="description">
                    <p>Manneken Pis has been an icon of Brussels’ culture well before Belgium even existed. The most popular legend that explains the story of the statue says that Brussels suffered from invaders, that robbed and lit fires across the city. One night, a little boy was woken up by the noise and noticed the fire. Having no water to extinguish it, he peed on the flames and prevented the city from burning down.</p>
                    <p>The first statue honoring this little boy was created in 1453, and it has been located in the Eikestraat ever since- although it has been stolen a few times as well. It was after such a robbery of Manneken Pis, by French soldiers in the War of Austrian Succession, that the statue received its first costume. This rapidly inspired the city of Brussels, as well as other places in Flanders and abroad, to donate new costumes to Manneken Pis. Let’s zoom in to see where all these costumes came from!</p>

                    <p>What is interesting here is the social and historical context and the engagement of each country with Manneken Pis. While costumes begin to adorn Manneken Pis as early as 1747, there are significant changes in donation numbers in different categories over the years, especially during the world wars. Understandably, world crises have impacted costume donations. For example, between 1918 and 1944 costumes are mostly military in nature, and the only non-European country to donate a costume during this time was the USA which was also a military costume. In the last five years, especially during the pandemic years Manneken Pis has been only dressed in costumes from Belgium with the only exception being in 2023, when Netherlands donated a costume after a gap of 20 years to commemorate the diplomatic relation between Belgium and the Netherlands. We can also see that France has consistently donated costumes resulting in one of the highest number of donations where donations from Netherlands is occasional.</p>

                    <p>In the bar graph below, you can observe how important each category of themes (culture, science, social and civic) is for each country. Each costume can represent multiple topics at once. The treemap below (the graph with the colored squares) represents the importance of the subthemes of each category for the six countries together (e.g. ‘folklore associations and ‘music’ for the ‘culture’ category). When you click on different parts of the bar graph, the treemap changes: when you click on the name of the country, the treemap will represent the theme representation for that country only. You can also click on a colored part of the bar graph (e.g. ‘culture’ in the bar of Belgium) to select only the division of culture-related topics in the treemap. Feel free to explore!</p>

                    <p>It becomes clear that ‘culture’ is the most important category for all countries. Besides culture, the civic and social categories are also represented in the costumes of each country, with civic costumes being more important than social costumes. Interestingly, ‘civic’ costumes mostly depict professions for each country, but for the United States, 8 costumes represent military topics. Among the culture-related topics, traditional costumes or folklore associations are the most represented for each country. The ‘science’ category only appears for Belgium, France and Italy.</p>

                    <p>In civic category, words like “professional,” “students” and “school” stand out, reflecting the category's focus on education and professional themes. However, it’s not the case for the United States, where words related to military themes such as “war,” “army," and “navy” dominate.</p>
                    <p>The science category predominantly relates to health issues, as evidenced by terms like “cancer,” “covid,” and “disease.” Costumes in this category primarily serve to “raise public awareness” about these health concerns, with frequent usage of these terms. Notably, Belgium is the sole contributor to this category.</p>
                    <p>The social category offers a more international perspective, emphasizing terms like “movement,” “activities,” and “initiatives.” It highlights the significant roles played by young people and organizations in addressing social issues. Spain, in particular, demonstrates a strong connection to sports, especially football.</p>
                    <p>The culture category is the most diverse, focusing on aspects of folklore and highlighting cultural-related terms such as “traditions,” “carnivals,” “anniversary,” and “festival.” These terms are notably prevalent in the word clouds for Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain, but less so in the U.S. In contrast, the American context features distinct terms such as “Disney,” “conflict,” “unified,” “independence,” and “indians,” which are closely linked to American history.</p>
